Welcome to the 2020 - 2021 Creative Labs Dedications (deds)! Deds is a yearly ritual
at CL where we write to all our seniors about why we love them. This repository is a
website that encapsulates our love to our amazing seniors.

We will miss you all ðŸ˜¢

## Getting Started

We used `Next.js`, `Typescript`, and `Sass`.

We prefer [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) as 
our package manager.

The basic commands to get this repository and start are:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BryanPan342/tears.git
$ cd tears
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

### Components

All reusuable components go inside the `components/` directory.

Notable components:
- `Layout.tsx`: The `Layout` component houses the layout for each page. Every page
must use the `Layout` component
- `RecordPlayer`: The `RecordPlayer` component is used on every screen and features
the playing music and positioning itself on the webpage

### Pages

All pages are registered in the `pages/` directory.

Notable pages:
- `[person].tsx`: This component is a dynamic route that creates a page for each
senior (i.e. `/arjun`)
- `index.tsx`: This component is the root route (i.e. `/`)

### Public

All assets are registered in the `public/` directory.

Notable assets:
- `songs/`: The songs for each senior is organized by the first name (i.e. `arjun/`)
  - `music.mp3`: The song dedicated to each senior
  - `vinyl-image.png`: The album cover for the song

### Utils

All utility functions are registered in the `utils/` directory.

Notable utilities:
- `node/`: This subdirectory is **necessary** to get an import of `../utils` to
function properly. If a page calls a `node.js` function, it will crash. Therefore, 
we need to separate all the `node.js` calls into a different section.
- `node/notion.ts`: This file contains all our Notion API calls to get the data to 
populate our pages
